# Protocol Reverser

A Go-based network protocol analysis tool that captures, analyzes, and optionally obfuscates network traffic. This tool is designed for network protocol analysis and reverse engineering.

## Features

- **Packet Capture**: Captures network packets from specified network interfaces
- **Protocol Analysis**: Analyzes network protocols by detecting common patterns:
  - Header detection
  - Length field identification
  - Delimiter recognition
- **Traffic Obfuscation**: Includes capabilities to obfuscate network traffic:
  - AES encryption
  - Jitter data insertion
  - Packet chunking with markers
  - PKCS7 padding

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.3 or later
- Npcap (Windows) or libpcap (Linux/macOS)
- Administrator/root privileges for packet capture

## Installation

1. Install Npcap (Windows) or libpcap (Linux/macOS)
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy

## Usage
### List Available Network Interfaces
bash
go run main.go -l


### Capture Packets
go run main.go -i "interface-name" -promisc=true -f "tcpÂ port 80"


Parameters:

- -i : Network interface name
- -s : Snapshot length (default: 1024)
- -promisc : Enable promiscuous mode (default: true)
- -f : BPF filter string
- -l : List available interfaces
## Project Structure
- main.go : Main application entry point and packet capture logic
- analyzer/protocol_analyzer.go : Protocol analysis implementation
- obfuscator/obfuscator.go : Traffic obfuscation functionality
